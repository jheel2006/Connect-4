# Connect-4

Connect 4 is typically a two player game and is played on a two-dimensional board with 7 columns and 6 rows. The players take turns by dropping their checker into a column of the board. The checkers fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The first player who gets 4 checkers in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally - wins the game.
